<h4 style="text-align:center">OUR MISSION</h4></br></br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Our goal is simple, and that is to provide our customers with lower energy rates. Utilities are rarely seen as </br>
  consumer items, and that means on average the idea of shopping around for the best service isn't seen as an </br>
  option. We aim to change this idea, and allow our customers to understand that there are plenty of options, </br>
  and like any purchase, it's best to consider your options and compare prices. </br>

</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">
  UNDERSTANDING ENERGY DEREGULATION
</h3>


<p style="text-align:center;">
  In 1996,  the Electricity Generation Customer Choice and Competition Act, was enacted. Allowing many PA citizens to choose their </br>
  own energy company. This meant PA residents could shop around for prices they were happy with, and no longer settle for the prices </br>
   they were offered.  </br> </br>

</p>
<hr width="900" size="1"  noshade color="black">
<p style="text-align:center;">

Three years later, the Natural Gas Choice and Competition Act was passed in 1999 and for the first time Pennsylvania residents </br>
were able to choose which companies supplied their natural gas commodities. For the first time in U.S. history, PA residents </br>
can now legally choose their electricity and natural gas company.  However, decades later, only several states in the U.S. have</br>
 deregulated energy markets that allow their residents to choose their energy company. PA is among the first states to provide </br>
 it's residents with the opportunity to choose their own energy plan. Although many PA residents are taking advantage of the </br>
 benefits of deregulation, we are passionate in providing the millions of others who have not yet take advantage of their freedom to choose.</br>
